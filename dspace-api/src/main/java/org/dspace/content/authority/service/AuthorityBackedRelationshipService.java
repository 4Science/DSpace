/**
 * Service for authority-aware operations which connect stored metadata to durable internal DSpace relationships.
 *
 * Authority-backed metadata can represent a reference before a concrete DSpace-to-DSpace relationship exists. Once
 * an authority value resolves to an internal {@link Item}, this service can validate the authority-specific state and
 * promote that reference to a durable {@link Relationship}. It also provides authority-aware operations for removing
 * relationship-backed metadata.
 *
 * Authority-specific validation belongs in this service. Generic metadata/relationship persistence and lifecycle
 * operations may be delegated to the corresponding metadata/relationship service layer. Callers should use the
 * compound operations defined here instead of independently changing authority metadata and the durable relationship,
 * as doing so may leave the two representations inconsistent.
