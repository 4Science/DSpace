			Scenario 2 - Author requests review with possible
			endorsement (via
			repository)
			Scenario 5 - Repository requests review
			(on behalf of corresponding author)
			Scenario 9 - Author requests
			review from review service, via

	<dc-type>
		<schema>coar</schema>
		<element>notify</element>
		<qualifier>examination</qualifier>
		<scope_note>
			Used to record the acceptance of the request to make a
			review and/or
			evaluate an endorsement. This means that the repository
			resource is
			under active examination.
			Once set the corresponding
			coar.notify.request metadata will be removed.
			If present, a
			coar.notify.refused metadata for the same third party
			service and with
			the same initialize repository message ID it will be
			removed. This
			allows the external service to amend a previous wrong
			acknowledgement.

	<dc-type>
		<schema>coar</schema>
		<element>notify</element>
		<qualifier>refused</qualifier>
		<scope_note>
			Used to record the rejection of the request to make a
			review and/or
			evaluate an endorsement. This means that the repository
			resource has
			been NOT examined. Please note that this is different
			from a negative
			review.
			Once set, the corresponding coar.notify.request
			metadata will be removed.
			If present, a coar.notify.examination
			metadata for the same third
			party service and with the same initialize
			repository message ID it
			will be removed. This allows the external
			service to amend a previous
			wrong acknowledgement.

	<dc-type>
		<schema>coar</schema>
		<element>notify</element>
		<qualifier>review</qualifier>
		<scope_note>
			Used to record a received review. It can also be
			unsolicited as in
			scenarios 1 and 8.
			Once set, the corresponding
			coar.notify.request and eventually the
			coar.notify.examination (or
			coar.notify.refused) metadata will be
			removed.
			The coar.notify.request
			should have been removed when the
			coar.notify.examination has been set
			but due to the async nature of
			the communication the acknowledge
			message from the review/endorsement
			service could have been lost.
			Moreover, acknowledgement is not
			guaranteed to be sent in all the
			scenarios.

	<dc-type>
		<schema>coar</schema>
		<element>notify</element>
		<qualifier>endorsement</qualifier>
		<scope_note>
			Used to record a received endorsement. It can also be unsolicited as in
			scenarios 1 and 4.
			Once set, the coar.notify.request / coar.notify.examination /
			coar.notify.refused metadata will be cleaned if present to deal with
			lost review messages or unplanned scenarios where the endorsement is
			granted without a review.
